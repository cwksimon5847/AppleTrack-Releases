#### Document 2 - Multi vs Single Document Interface
*This document of the guide is not needed to be read to understand the basics of AppleTrack Max, so you can skip this section if desired.*

AppleTrack Max uses Multi-Document interface, to house it's sub-programs under one main program, the primary AppleTrack Max program.

 - **Multi-Document Interface**: multiple child (sub) windows reside under a single parent (main) window.
 - **Single-Document Interface**: each document is contained in its own primary window
